Title Screen: 600 x 600 background

Think about the intro before level 1

Level one: needs 600x600 background (note the bottom 240 pixels will be covered by tiles)

Map tiles:
    -could be universally themed so each level just changes the color scheme
    -30 x 30 tiles, think about minecraft for example
    -powerups and interactable items (have to be 30 x 30, you could make extra space transparent)

Code: -***basically look at fble API and we have to remake every mothod in some way
    -score system
    -button mapping
    -sprite movement (look at fble player movement)
    -map arrays (bottom of fble) (need at least 10 randomized tile layouts similar to daubs adventure ones)
